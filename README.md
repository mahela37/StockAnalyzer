# Running  the code

Run the code using: `python main.py`

First time you run the code, it will complain about some missing libraries. Will need to install using pip.
- eg: `pip install pyyaml`



TODO LATER: Set up a setup file or requirements.txt so that new developers don't need to manually pip install each package.
